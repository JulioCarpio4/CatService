Version your API: 
- One good practice is always add the version to the 
path in the API, so users can still be using the 
previous version without breaking anything or 
forcing them to use the new one. Ex: /api/v1/route

Name resources in plural: 
It is a good practice to manage resources in plural. 
Always remember: Your API is used by other humans and should be precise. 
This goes also for naming your resources.

I always imagine a resource like a box. 
In our example the box is a collection that stores different cats.

Group Associated resources together: 
This means being able to nest our URLs, for
example if we have let say cat vaccination records
we could have something like 
api/v1/cats/:catId/vaccinations to ask for the 
vaccine records for a specific cat. 
A GOOD RULE OF THUMB IS TO ONLY NEST THREE LEVELS
DEEP AT MAXIMUM

Integrate filtering, sorting and pagination:
Performance of the API is always a key factor!!
